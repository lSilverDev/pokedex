# Pokedex

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.4.

This project uses pokéAPI V2 - https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2

For this project, I used PokeAPI v2 to build a simple Pokédex. Currently, you can see all Pokémon, some alternative forms, and more details like HP, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, and speed stats. 

Soon, you will be able to see a Pokémon's evolutionary line, requirements for evolution, search for a Pokémon, and more.
